# IMPROVEMENTS — active backlog

Areas to optimise, hardened list. Ordered by priority within each tier.
Keep this in sync with the **Change log** in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.html` — when an item
ships, move it to **Done** here *and* add a dated row there in the same batch.

Legend: **💰** = carries monetary cost or financial/legal liability → needs explicit
owner go-ahead before implementing. **⚠️** = touches the payment/checkout path → extra
care, land behind tests, never "blind".

## Done

### Batch: Incremental units-sold tally (`product_sales`) — 2026-08-29 13:20 IST
- Migration `0042` — `product_sales(product_id, units_sold, updated_at)` aggregate (RLS on,
  no policy) + `apply_product_sales(p_items jsonb, p_sign int)` RPC: signed per-line-item
  delta, `greatest(0, …)` clamp, one call. `EXECUTE` revoked from public/anon/authenticated,
  re-granted to `service_role` (same inherited-grant gotcha as `0041`). One-time backfill
  from every non-cancelled order's `items`. **Applied to the live DB 2026-08-29.**
- `app/api/razorpay-webhook/route.ts` block *1c* — best-effort `rpc("apply_product_sales",
  { p_items: orderItems, p_sign: 1 })` after the order insert.
- `app/api/admin/orders/update-status/route.ts` — reads prior `status` before the update;
  on a real transition *into* `cancelled` (not a re-save), best-effort
  `apply_product_sales(… p_sign: -1)`.
- `getSoldCounts` (`app/utils/storeQueries.ts`) — now reads `product_sales` instead of
  scanning the last 300 non-cancelled orders, so the customer-facing "N sold" count is
  exact past 300 lifetime orders. Still tag `orders`; any read failure → `{}` as before.
  `getBestsellers` / `getRelatedProducts` keep the 300-order scan (relative ranking only).
- **Verified end-to-end 2026-08-29.** Static: `next build` exit 0 (240 pages), `tsc`
  clean, `npm test` 51/7. Deployed (`c876eee` → `main`), then a clean isolated test on a
  zero-sales product against the production DB: test-mode order took the tally `0 → 1`;
  admin-panel cancel took it `1 → 0`; re-saving the already-cancelled order left it at `0`
  (prior-status guard held). One backfill straddler (a product-87 order counted by the
  backfill, then cancelled before this hook shipped) sat `+1` high — corrected by hand.
  Revert target `d2836b6`. (was Tier 1 #2.)
- **Known limitation:** the tally only self-corrects for cancels via
  `/api/admin/orders/update-status`. Any other cancel path leaves it high — the drift-scan
  query (now in ARCHITECTURE.html §7) is the standing check. A scheduled reconcile is a
  possible follow-up (Tier 4).

### Batch: Atomic stock decrement + oversell alert — 2026-08-29 12:33 IST
- Migration `0041` — `decrement_inventory(p_product_id, p_qty)`: `SELECT … FOR UPDATE`
  row lock, one atomic call, returns `(new_inventory, oversold_by)`. `EXECUTE` revoked
  from public/anon/authenticated. **Applied to the live DB (verified in `pg_proc`) before
  the code merged.**
- `app/api/razorpay-webhook/route.ts` — per-item read-modify-write loop → one
  `supabase.rpc("decrement_inventory", …)` per line. Concurrent webhooks for the same
  product now serialise on the row lock instead of racing. `oversold_by > 0` fires a
  business "OVERSELL — action needed" WhatsApp (`sendOversellAlert`). Low-stock alert and
  the "no revalidateTag" behaviour preserved. (was Tier 1 #1; #2 partly — see #1 below
  for the remaining reservation-window follow-up.)
- **Verified end-to-end 2026-08-29.** Static: `next build` exit 0, `tsc` clean, `npm test`
  51/7. DB via SQL: decrement/clamp/`oversold_by` correct, unknown id → 0 rows, `EXECUTE`
  service_role-only, `products` RLS + policy intact. Live test-mode payment: order row
  created, WhatsApp + email delivered, inventory −1 exactly. (Oversell branch + true
  concurrency not hit live — SQL test covered the logic.) Revert target `57ffd29`.
- Fix commit `69fbaf6`: `grant execute … to service_role` in `0041` (the `revoke from
  public` had stripped it). If re-applying `0041` elsewhere, that grant is now included.

### Batch: Share the recent-orders scan — 2026-08-29 11:23 IST
- New cached `getRecentOrderItems` (last 300 orders' `items`, tag `orders`);
  `getBestsellers` + `getRelatedProducts` share it instead of two near-identical
  cold-cache scans. Tally extracted to a pure `app/utils/orderTally.ts`
  (`tallyUnitsSold`) with 8 unit tests. `getSoldCounts` unchanged (needs the 300 most
  recent *non-cancelled* orders — a different set). (was Tier 3 #12.)
- One immaterial shift: equal-units-sold tie-break at the top-N cutoff is now id order,
  not recency. No correctness/revenue impact on a ranking strip.
- Verified: `next build` exit 0 (240 pages), `tsc` clean, `npm test` 51 pass / 7 gated,
  eslint −2 on `storeQueries.ts`, no new errors.

### Batch: Confirmations link to the invoice — 2026-08-29 10:46 IST
- Customer order-confirmation WhatsApp + email (`/api/razorpay-webhook`) now carry a
  `/success?order_id=` link / "View / print invoice" button (`invoiceUrl` param, customer
  email copy only). The shipped + delivered WhatsApp messages
  (`/api/admin/orders/update-status`) get the same link.
- Copy-only inside the webhook's best-effort notification block — no touch to signature
  checks, idempotency, the order insert, stock, or coupons.
- Verified: `next build` exit 0 (240 pages), `tsc` clean, `npm test` 43 pass / 7 gated,
  eslint no new errors. Not exercised against a live message send.
- Closes the follow-up noted on the batch below.

### Batch: Receipt survives a lost session — 2026-08-29 10:29 IST
- New `/api/orders/receipt` (public POST, phone-gated like `/api/orders/track`) rebuilds
  the invoice from the stored order; fires no purchase analytics.
- `/success` recovers via that route when `sessionStorage` is gone but the URL carries
  `?order_id=` (refresh / reopened tab). `CartDrawer` redirect now carries `?order_id=`.
  sessionStorage fast path + conversion firing unchanged. (was Tier 2 #7.)
- Verified: `next build` exit 0 (240 pages), `tsc` clean, `npm test` 43 pass / 7 gated,
  eslint no new errors. Client recovery flow not exercised end-to-end (no running
  checkout) — the API route is fully covered; the page/CartDrawer changes are a small
  additive redirect + form.
- Follow-up (done — see the batch above): link the WhatsApp/email confirmations to
  `/success?order_id=`.

### Batch: Keepalive heartbeat visibility — 2026-08-29 02:55 IST
- `/api/keepalive` stamps `site_settings.last_keepalive_at` on every run (best-effort,
  no cache revalidation). Admin **Overview** tab shows a heartbeat card + an amber
  "Check" badge when it's > 90 min stale — a dead external scheduler is now visible
  instead of only surfacing days later as Green API going idle. Staleness derived in
  `loadAll()`, not render. (was Tier 4 #14.)
- Rider: 1 `prefer-const` fix in `razorpay-webhook`. Net eslint delta −1.
- Verified: `next build` exit 0 (239 pages), `tsc` clean, `npm test` 43 pass / 7 gated,
  eslint no new errors.

### Batch: CI + error-hygiene sweep — 2026-08-29 02:42 IST
- **CI wired.** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — the repo had none. Runs `tsc --noEmit` +
  `npm test` + `next build` on push to `main` and every PR. RLS test runs for real if
  Supabase vars are set as Actions secrets, else self-skips. No ESLint job (pre-existing
  debt, #19). Remaining: add the Actions secrets + branch protection so a red CI blocks
  merge — that's a repo-settings action for the owner, not code.
- **5xx error scrubbing — whole `app/api` surface.** Extended `serverErrorResponse` to
  every remaining admin route (22 files) + `/api/catalogue`, `/api/categories`,
  `/api/check-whatsapp-number`, `/api/cron/abandoned-checkout`, `/api/razorpay-webhook`,
  `/api/settings`. No route echoes raw exception / Postgres text in a 5xx; every
  `catch (err: any)` feeding a 5xx in `app/api` is gone. (was Tier 2 #6 — complete.)
- Verified: `next build` exit 0 (239 SSG pages), `tsc --noEmit` clean, `npm test`
  43 pass / 7 gated, eslint no new errors.

### Batch: Security & hygiene #2 (data perimeter) — 2026-08-29 02:01 IST
- **RLS regression test** — `app/utils/rls.test.ts`: anon key cannot read
  `orders`/`coupons`/hidden products/unapproved reviews and cannot write; *can* read
  non-hidden products. Env-gated (skips without Supabase creds → CI stays green).
  **Verified 7/7 against the live project.** (was Tier 2 #5)
- **`supabase/migrations/0000_base_schema.sql`** — reconstructed base `products`/`orders`
  DDL so a fresh/staging project is reproducible from the folder. `IF NOT EXISTS`
  throughout (no-op on prod). **Verified against live 2026-08-29** (information_schema
  introspection) — corrected identity to `BY DEFAULT`, `images` to `text[]`, `inventory`
  to `bigint`/nullable, and several columns to nullable. (was Tier 1 #4.)
- **5xx error scrubbing — public routes done.** Extended `serverErrorResponse` to
  `/api/leads`, `/api/contact`, `/api/reviews`, `/api/enquiries`, `/api/track-view`,
  `/api/stock-alerts`, `/api/coupons/validate`. (was Tier 2 #6 — admin routes remain.)
- Verified: `next build` exit 0 (239 SSG pages), `tsc --noEmit` clean, `npm test`
  43 pass / 7 gated, `rls.test.ts` 7/7 live.

### Batch: Security & hygiene #1 — 2026-08-29 01:14 IST
- **Admin CSRF guard** — `proxy.ts` rejects a mutating method on `/api/admin/*` whose
  `Origin` header is cross-host. Defense-in-depth on top of the `sameSite:lax` cookie.
- **Log-table pruning** — opportunistic (2% of writes) deletes for
  `whatsapp_otp_verifications` (>7d) and `admin_login_attempts` (>90d), mirroring
  `rateLimit.ts` / `track-view`. (`whatsapp_enquiries` deliberately *not* pruned — it
  feeds all-time admin analytics.)
- **Shared `LOW_STOCK_THRESHOLD`** — new `app/utils/stock.ts`; removed 6 copies.
- **5xx error-body scrubbing** — new `app/utils/apiError.ts`; wired into `/api/razorpay`
  and `/api/orders/track`. (Remaining routes are a mechanical follow-up — see below.)
- **`notInListLiteral`** exported from `storeQueries.ts` instead of copy-pasted into
  `labels/bulk-assign`.
- **GST tests** — +6 cases (3-rate baskets, uneven discount split, over-discount clamp,
  empty basket).
- Verified: `next build` exit 0 (156 SSG pages), `tsc --noEmit` clean, `npm test` 43/43.

## Active — Tier 1 (correctness / money)

1. **⚠️ Non-atomic stock deduction in the webhook.**
   The concurrent-webhook race and oversell surfacing are fixed and **verified end-to-end**
   — see Done (2026-08-29 12:33): migration `0041` `decrement_inventory()` + `rpc()` +
   `sendOversellAlert`; a live test-mode payment confirmed order + WhatsApp + email +
   inventory −1. What's left is a separate, larger piece: a **short-TTL stock reservation
   at order creation** so two checkouts for the last unit can't both *pay*. Needs a written
   design first (⚠️ payment path) — not started; awaiting owner go-ahead.

2. ~~**Sold-count accuracy degrades past ~300 orders.**~~ — **done + verified end-to-end
   2026-08-29** (see Done, batch 13:20). `product_sales` aggregate + `apply_product_sales`
   RPC (`0042`), `getSoldCounts` reads it, webhook +1, admin cancel −1, all confirmed
   against prod. `getBestsellers`/`getRelatedProducts` keep the 300-order scan on purpose.

3. **Adopt the Supabase CLI for migrations.** — *partly done (2026-08-29).* CLI installed +
   linked (project `gxlervcazzddqcoagewy`); `0000_base_schema.sql` **verified against live**
   via SQL introspection and corrected. **Blocked on Docker** for the rest: `supabase db
   pull` / `db dump` / `db push` all shell out to a container, and `db push` also needs the
   43 existing migrations backfilled into the remote `schema_migrations` table (`supabase
   migration repair --status applied 0000…0042`). Until Docker Desktop is installed,
   migrations stay hand-pasted into the SQL editor (which works fine). Still open: the RLS
   `pg_policies` snapshot check (can be a plain SQL query in a scheduled job — no CLI
   needed).

## Active — Tier 2 (security / hardening)

5. ~~**Make CI enforcing.**~~ — **done + confirmed (2026-08-29).** Branch-protection
   ruleset (Active) on the default branch requires the `verify` status check; a direct
   `git push origin main` is rejected (`GH013 … Required status check "verify" is
   expected`). The 5 Actions secrets are set — PR #3's `verify` run passed all checks with
   the real build. Deploy flow is now PR-based (see Done batch 14:30 + working agreement).

7. ~~`/success` shouldn't depend on `sessionStorage`~~ — **done** (2026-08-29). Follow-up:
   link the WhatsApp/email order confirmations to `/success?order_id=` so the buyer has a
   one-tap route back to a printable invoice.

8. ~~Prune / retain remaining log tables (`leads`, `whatsapp_enquiries`).~~ — **deferred
   by owner (2026-08-29): leave as-is.** Both tables stay unbounded. They're small and
   `whatsapp_enquiries` feeds all-time admin analytics, so no automatic prune. Revisit only
   if row counts ever become a real cost/perf problem.

## Active — Tier 3 (cost / performance — several are 💰)

9. **💰 Re-enable Image Optimization** — **on hold, no-cost path only (owner, 2026-08-29).**
   `images.unoptimized: true` stays until the Vercel quota cycle resets and it can be
   dropped for free (tracked in auto-memory `vercel_image_optimization_unoptimized_flag.md`).
   Supabase Storage image transforms (`?width=`) are ruled out — they need the Pro plan (💰).
   No action until the free trigger; then just remove the flag.

10. **`count: "exact"` on every catalog query** (`getCatalogPage`) is a full scan.
    Premature at ~140 products; revisit at scale with `count: "planned"` + a separately
    cached exact count.

11. **Collapse the 10 context providers.** Most fetch `/api/settings` or `/api/categories`
    on mount — several client round trips per page load for data the server already has.
    One `/api/bootstrap` + one provider. Larger refactor — do behind a running app.

12. ~~Share the "last 300 orders" scan~~ — **done** (2026-08-29) for `getBestsellers` +
    `getRelatedProducts` via `getRecentOrderItems`. `getSoldCounts` now reads the
    `product_sales` aggregate instead (`0042`, 2026-08-29).

## Active — Tier 4 (maintainability / observability)

16. **`product_sales` reconcile check.** The tally (`0042`) only self-corrects for cancels
    via `/api/admin/orders/update-status`; any other cancel path leaves it high. The
    drift-scan query is in ARCHITECTURE.html §7 but has to be run by hand. Options: a
    weekly cron that runs the recompute and alerts on any mismatch, or fold it into the
    existing keepalive/health cron. Cheap, free, no payment-path risk.

13. **Error monitoring.** — *deferred by owner (2026-08-29): no Sentry.* Dozens of
    best-effort `console.error` (WhatsApp, email, stock deduction) vanish in Vercel's
    short log retention — a systematically failing Green API is invisible. Owner's plan:
    rely on **Vercel Pro** observability (longer log retention + log drains) if/when
    traffic justifies the upgrade. Revisit only then; until upgrade, the admin Overview
    heartbeat card (#14) is the only health signal. Cheap stop-gap still open: extend that
    card / a health cron to surface repeated Green-API send failures.

14. ~~Keepalive staleness alert~~ — **done** (2026-08-29). Follow-up: the
    `abandoned-checkout` cron still has no health signal; same pattern could cover it.

15. **Generate DB types** (`supabase gen types typescript` → `types/db.ts`) — kills the
    pervasive `any` on products/orders/API bodies.

16. **Split `app/admin/page.tsx`** (~3,600 lines, one client component) into route
    segments / lazy tabs. Improves admin TTI and maintainability.

17. **Extract the checkout state machine** from `CartDrawer.tsx` (~1,150 lines) into a
    reducer/hook.

18. **Consolidate phone normalisation** — reimplemented with slightly different rules in
    `whatsappOtp.ts`, `whatsapp-numbers/route.ts`, `stock-alerts/route.ts`,
    `greenApi.ts`. ⚠️ touches OTP — preserve each call site's exact behaviour, land with
    tests.

19. **Clear the pre-existing lint debt** — `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` and
    `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` errors across the repo (`npm run lint` is not
    clean; Next 16 no longer runs it during `next build`).

20. **Delete vestigial `ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET`** from the env (nothing reads it).

## Active — Tier 5 (tests)

21. **Integration-test the payment path.** The "reprice every item from DB" guard in
    `/api/razorpay` is security-critical and untested. Also untested: webhook
    idempotency, coupon `used_count` increment.
